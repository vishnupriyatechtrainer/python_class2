No problem at all — let’s go **super simple** and start from the beginning. I’ll guide you **step by step** like you’re doing it for the first time. By the end, you'll be able to create a project and upload it to GitHub.

---

## 🟢 Goal: Upload a simple project to GitHub from your computer

---

## 🧩 STEP 1: Check What You Have Installed

✅ You said:

* You have a **GitHub account** ✅
* You **installed Git** ✅ (you can check by typing this in your terminal or CMD):

```bash
git --version
```

You should see something like: `git version 2.xx.x`.
If yes — you're good to go.

---

## 📁 STEP 2: Create a Simple Project on Your Computer

1. Go to your desktop.
2. Create a new folder called `my-first-github-project`.
3. Inside that folder, create a file named `hello.txt` and write something like:

```
Hello GitHub!
```

---

## 🌐 STEP 3: Create a Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and **log in**.
2. Click the **"+" icon** in the top right > **"New repository"**
3. Fill in:

   * Repository name: `my-first-github-project`
   * Description: `This is my first project on GitHub!` (optional)
   * Public (or Private)
   * ✅ Check: **"Add a README file"**
4. Click **"Create repository"**

## 💻 STEP 4: Open Terminal (Command Prompt or Git Bash)

### Change to your project folder:

```bash
cd Desktop/my-first-github-project
```

### Initialize Git in your folder:

```bash
git init
```

### Connect your folder to GitHub:

Go to your GitHub repo page → Click **"Code"** → Select **HTTPS** → Copy the link.
It looks like:

```
https://github.com/your-username/my-first-github-project.git
```

Now in terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-first-github-project.git
```

---

## ✅ STEP 5: Add & Upload Your File

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "My first commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

It will ask for your **GitHub username and password**.

> 📌 **Note**: If password doesn’t work, GitHub now uses **personal access tokens** instead of passwords. I can show you how to get one if needed.

---

## 🎉 STEP 6: Check on GitHub

Go to your repository page and you’ll see your file `hello.txt` uploaded!

---

## 🔁 Summary of Commands You Used

```bash
cd Desktop/my-first-github-project
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-first-github-project.git
git add .
git commit -m "My first commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 💬 Want to Try It Together?

Tell me where you're stuck (e.g. creating repo, terminal command, login), and I’ll walk you through just that part.

Would you like help creating the GitHub token to log in during `git push`?





Great — you're almost there! Git is just asking:
**“Who are you?”** so it can record your name and email with the commit.

Let’s fix this in **two simple steps**:

---

## ✅ Step 1: Set Your Name and Email in Git

In your terminal (or Git Bash), run these two commands.
Replace the name and email with **your actual GitHub account details**.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

📌 Example:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Ankit Sharma"
git config --global user.email "ankit.sharma123@gmail.com"
```

---

## ✅ Step 2: Try Committing Again

Now re-run your commit command:

```bash
git commit -m "my first commit"
```

It should work now 🎉

---

### 🧠 What Does This Do?

* `--global` means this sets your name/email for **all Git projects on your computer**.
* You only have to do this **once**.

Would you like me to guide you through the next step — pushing your code to GitHub?


Save and push the changes:


git add index.html
git commit -m "Add homepage"
git push origin main
